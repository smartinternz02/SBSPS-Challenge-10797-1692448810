## Overview
Campus recruitment analysis and prediction constitute a strategic approach that harnesses data analysis and predictive modeling to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of recruitment processes within educational institutions. This method empowers organizations to comprehensively evaluate historical data, identify trends, and anticipate outcomes, thereby optimizing their recruitment strategies for the future. This project aims to analyze historical campus recruitment data and develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a student's placement based on various features.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of campus recruitment data and create a predictive model that can assist in identifying factors contributing to successful placements.

## Installation and Setup

To get started with this project, follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/smartinternz02/SBSPS-Challenge-10797-1692448810.git
```  
2. **Visual studio code:** Launch VS Code to access the project notebooks:

3. **Navigate to Project Directory:** Move to the project directory:
```bash
cd Campus-Recruitment-Analysis-and-Prediction
```
4.**Install Required Packages:** Install the necessary libraries and packages using `pip` or `conda`:

The `requirements.txt` file contains a list of required packages with their versions.
You can use the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5.**Data Loading:** Place the dataset file (e.g., `campus_recruitment.csv`) into the appropriate directory (e.g., `data/`).

6.**Setup Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):** Its recommended to set up a virtual environment for this project to manage dependencies. You can use `virtualenv` or `conda` for this purpose. The below commands has to be typed in base environment of conda in command prompt terminal.

```bash
conda create -p venv python==3.10
conda activate venv/
```

7.**Explore the Notebooks:** Open the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to follow the analysis and prediction process step by step.

8.**Run:** To run, type the following command in terminal
```bash
python prediction.py
```
